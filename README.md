# Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab

## Overview

Every cybersecurity journey begins with an essential first step: establishing a strong foundational understanding of core security concepts. Just as you need a solid base to build a sturdy structure, a cybersecurity professional must have a solid understanding of these principles. Thatâ€™s why I started an exciting lab-building project designed to enhance practical skills through immersive, hands-on experiences.

**Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** is a home lab series created by Francois B. Arthanas who is also founder of <a href="https://www.cyberprostraining.com">Cyber Pros Training</a>. The introductory video for the series has been uploaded to his Youtube channel and can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTuzRKmdmlQ">here</a>.

I wish to offer a big thanks to Francois for creating this amazing project! I will be updating this writeup as more labs continue to be introduced.

As always, the goal behind documeting this project is to showcase the pracital knowledge and experience I've obtained as a result of completeing each lab in the series.
