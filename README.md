# Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab

## Overview

Every cybersecurity journey begins with a crucial first step: establishing a solid understanding of core security concepts. That's why I've embarked on an exciting lab-building project designed to enhance practical skills through immersive, hands-on experiences.

**Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** is a series created by Francois B. Arthanas, founder of <a href="https://www.cyberprostraining.com">Cyber Pros Training</a>. The introductory video for the series is available on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTuzRKmdmlQ">YouTube</a> channel. As the **Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** has paid sections only accessible through Cyber Pros Training, I will limit this write-up to the free modules uploaded to YouTube.

It is also crucial to have a fundamental understanding of networking, as these principles serve as the backbone for all cybersecurity concepts. To deepen this understanding, I will be integrating practical labs from Mr. Arthanasâ€™s **CompTIA Network+ Free Training**, which can be accessed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/2w8WOGUSfGI?si=qUyvRd8MYpwnz0IS">here</a>.

I want to express my gratitude to Francois for creating this amazing project! If any additional modules are released to the public, I will be sure to update this write-up. 

As always, my goal in documenting every project in this portfolio is to showcase the practical knowledge and experience I've gained through learning.
