# Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab

## Overview

Every cybersecurity journey begins with a crucial first step: establishing a solid understanding of core security concepts. That's why I've embarked on an exciting lab-building project designed to enhance practical skills through immersive, hands-on experiences.

**Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** is a series created by Francois B. Arthanas, founder of <a href="https://www.cyberprostraining.com">Cyber Pros Training</a>. The introductory video for the series is available on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTuzRKmdmlQ">YouTube</a> channel. As the **Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** has paid sections only accessible through Cyber Pros Training, I will limit this write-up to the free modules uploaded to YouTube.

I want to express my gratitude to Francois for creating this amazing project! If any additional modules are released to the public, I will be sure to update the relevant sections. 

As always, my goal in documenting any project in this portfolio is to showcase the practical knowledge and experience I've gained through my learning.
