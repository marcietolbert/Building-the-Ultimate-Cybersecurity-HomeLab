# Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab

## Overview

Every cybersecurity journey begins with a crucial first step: establishing a solid understanding of core security concepts. That's why I've embarked on an exciting lab-building project designed to enhance practical skills through immersive, hands-on experiences.

**Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** is a series created by Francois B. Arthanas, founder of <a href="https://www.cyberprostraining.com">Cyber Pros Training</a>. The introductory video for the series is available on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTuzRKmdmlQ">YouTube</a> channel. I have chosen to do a write-up on this project and combine it with labs from Mr. Arthanasâ€™s **CompTIA Network+ Free Training** found here. 

This lab will provide an environment for the practical application of core security concepts. I will also be installing Cisco Packet Tracer, which will serve as an additional resource for understanding key networking fundamentals.

I would like to extend my gratitude to Francois for creating this incredible project! I will be updating this write-up as more labs are introduced. 

As always, my goal in documenting this and every project in this portfolio is to showcase the practical knowledge and experience I've gained through labbing.
