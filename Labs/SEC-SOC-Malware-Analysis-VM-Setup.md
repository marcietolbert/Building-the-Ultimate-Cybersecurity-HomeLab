# SEC, SOC, Malware Analysis VM Setup
Welcome to **Lab 00**, the first lab in the **Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** series. In this guided session, I will walk you through the steps to download and configure six distinct virtual machines that will be hosted on VMware Workstation Pro. Additionally, I will provide clear instructions on how to download and set up VMware Workstation Pro itself.

Before we begin the configuration process, let's first examine the logical structure of our lab environment. This visual representation will help you understand how the devices in this lab interact with one another. We will use Lucidchart, a user-friendly online diagramming tool, to create this logical diagram. 

Let’s get started!

## Logical Diagram

## Kali Linux Download and Configuration
Now that we have installed and configured VMware Workstation Pro, let's set up our first virtual machine: Kali Linux. Kali Linux is a Debian-based distribution specifically designed for penetration testing and ethical hacking. This operating system includes a comprehensive suite of pre-installed security tools, making it an ideal choice for simulating real-world cyberattacks and various security scenarios. These tools range from network analyzers to vulnerability scanners, all aimed at helping security professionals identify and address vulnerabilities effectively.

### Setup
Going forward, we need to unzip and install the files we download. If you don't already have it installed, visit <a href="https://www.7-zip.org"/>7-Zip</a>, click *Download*, and choose the .exe file that matches your operating system to install it.
<br>
<br>
<img width="786" alt="OsNvI3ssT9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e4db891-a7df-43d7-b67c-0f750b607ae2"/>
<br>
<br>

- Create a folder named **SecLab** on the host machine's **C:** drive, then create a subfolder named **ISO** to organize all future downloads.
<br>

- Go to the <a href="https://www.kali.org/"/>Kali Linux</a> website and click *Download*.

<br>
<br>

- Click the Kali Linux machine to select it.
<img width="1752" height="960" alt="9N6WIRxX6Q" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21912ba1-df33-4f97-af77-353fadc65a05" />
<br>
<br>

***Note:*** *In the main pane of this virtual machine, the username and password are listed in the **Description** section.*
<br>
<br>

- Now we need to change some settings for the virtual machine. Click on *Edit virtual machine settings*.
<img width="1752" height="960" alt="yHfI9cOZ6g" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/784f1466-7f27-4fae-973d-5a68688d6534" />
<br>
<br>

- Change the memory to 8 GB while keeping the other default settings, then click *OK*.
<img width="563" height="534" alt="3Q0kZmL68y" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9efa74e5-f3d7-4752-968b-ddb05fd89519" />
<br>
<br>

- Start the Kali Linux machine by double-clicking its name in the library pane or by clicking the green play button next to *Power on this virtual machine*.

<br>
<br>

- If you get a pop-up that appears click *Ok* and wait for the machine to boot.
<br>
<br>

- If you remember, the username and password to log into the machine are "kali:kali". Use these credentials to log in.
<img width="387" height="218" alt="vmware_Ft6dBJqaAF" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/903ffafc-7949-4cde-a679-892859ad7dfc" />
<br>
<br>

Let’s ensure that we can access the external network.
<br>
<br>

- Open a terminal session and ping Goggle by entering the command `ping 8.8.8.8`.
<img width="319" height="105" alt="kJ3wwazfck" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66d90229-367d-47c2-9089-c37cc7967989" />
<br>
<br>

If there are no lost packets, it means the virtual machines' network traffic successfully reached the external network and a Google server.
<img width="512" height="257" alt="Fez6g8oyr3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2de9f65-6906-4b0a-aa00-0ad16bc57847" />
<br>
<br>

Let's look at the IP address of this machine.

- Enter `ifconfig` into the terminal.
<img width="308" height="71" alt="YJySzGpMuM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e950fd89-421b-435a-88af-bd6612bdf9fa" />
<br>
<br>

- Under inet we can see that the machine's IP address is 10.0.0.10. This confirms that the starting range we configured for the DHCP server successfully assigned the first machine we installed an address that ends in .10.
<img width="450" height="247" alt="Nd9BiK4UyF" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3380d3df-3414-46d1-bfb2-5c6cfe74b414" />
<br>
<br>

- Run the command `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` to refreash and install the newest versions of all packages currently installed on the system.
<img width="518" height="162" alt="R09Y7imtb2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db60ee65-b432-4f0a-bccd-8878a77c1269" />
<br>
<br>

- Take a snapshot of the current state of the machine by right-clicking the virtual machine in the library and navigating to *Snapshot > Take Snapshot*. Name the snapshot and add a description before clicking *Take Snapshot* to save.
<img width="260" height="167" alt="FF2jbzFFXK" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0cb9eb4-1188-45d8-820a-91ae23670548" />
<br>
<br>

- Minimize the machine.

## Metasploitable Download and Configuration
Our next task is to download the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine. First, let’s clarify what Metasploitable 2 is. It is a deliberately vulnerable target machine designed to test common vulnerabilities. In our lab environment, it will serve as a device that can be attacked by our Kali Linux machine.

With that's said lets get to it!

### Setup
- Download the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/metasploitable">here</a>.
<br>
<br>

- Extract the file.
<br>
<br>

- Move or copy the Metasploitable 2 folder into the *SecLab > ISO* folder we created earlier.
<br>
<br>

- Rename the folder “Meta”.
<br>
<br>

- Open the **Meta** folder, then open the fourth file to launch the Metasploitable 2 virtual machine in VMware Workstation Pro.
<br>
<br>

- Move the virtual machine into the **SecLab** folder and rename the virtual machine “Meta”.
<br>
<br>

*Remember that the default username and password for the virtual machine is msfadmin:msfadmin.*

- Click on *Edit virtual machine settings*.
<br>
<br>

- Click *Ok* to confirm and then power on the virtual machine.
<br>
<br>

- Click *Ok* for the first pop-up and select *I Moved It* for the second pop-up.
<br>
<br>

- Log into the machine using the provided username and password.
<br>
<br>

*Note: The username and password can also be found above the login prompt.*

- Check the machine's IP address, enter ifconfig at the command prompt, which ends with $. Look for inet, which will show 10.0.0.11 as your IP address.
<br>
<br>

- Now, let's test the connection to the Kali machine by entering the command: `ping 10.0.0.10`.
<br>
<br>

- Wait a couple of seconds before pressing *CTRL > c* to stop the ping.
<br>
<br>

- If packets sent successfully reach the Kali machine, then the two machines can communicate with each other.
<br>
<br>

*Note: You can specify the number of packets to send, eliminating the need to manually stop the ping.*

- Execute the command `ping -c 4 10.0.0.10`. This command instructs the shell to stop pinging after sending 4 ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets and receiving 4 ECHO_RESPONSE packets.
<br>
<br>

- Finally, let's update and upgrade the machine. Enter the command `sudo apt update`, followed by `sudo apt upgrade -y`.
<br>
<br>

*Note: Sudo is used to run the command as the superuser, as elevated privileges are needed to update and upgrade the machine. The -y option will automatically respond with "yes" to any prompts that require a yes or no response when the shell executes the command.*

You can now shut down both the Kali Linux and Metasploitable machines.

## Ubuntu Client Download and Configuration
We will now be installing Ubuntu Desktop, which is a user-friendly, free, and open-source operating system.

### Setup
- Go to Ubuntu’s website <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">here</a> and click Download Ubuntu.
<br>
<br>

- To download the latest LTS version of Ubuntu desktop, click the green download button on the download page.
<br>
<br>

- Save the Ubuntu desktop file to the *SecLab > ISO* folder.
<br>
<br>

- Back in VMware Workstation Pro click *Home > Create a New Virtual Machine*.
<br>
<br>

- In the **New Virtual Machine** wizard, follow these steps:
    - Ensure that **Typical (Recommended)** is selected, then click *Next*.
    - Click *Browse* under the **Installer disk image file** section and select the Ubuntu desktop .iso file located in the *SecLab > ISO* folder, then click *Open* and proceed by clicking *Next*.
    - For the Full Name, enter "Ubuntu Client." Use "Ubuntu" as the username and choose a simple password of your choice. Click *Next* to continue.
    - Remove “64-bit” from the virtual machine name so that it simply reads "Ubuntu," then click *Next*.
    - Change the maximum disk size to 100 GB and click *Next*.
<br>
<br>

- Review the settings, then click on *Customize Hardware*.
<br>
<br>

- Adjust the memory to 8 GB and set the processor to 2 cores, then click *Close*.
<br>
<br>

- Review the settings once more, and then click *Finish*.
<br>
<br>

- The installation will now start automatically. Once the screen prompts you to choose your language, select the following settings:
    - **Language:** English (or your preferred language) and click *Next*.
    - **Accessibility:** Click *Skip*.
    -**Keyboard Layout:** English (or your preferred language) and click *Next*.
    - **Connect to the Internet:** Use a wired connection and click *Next*.
    - **Updates:** Click *Skip*.
    - **What do you want to do with Ubuntu:** Select *Install Ubuntu* and click *Next*.
    - **How would you like to install Ubuntu:** Choose *Interactive Installation* and click *Next*.
    - **What apps would you like to install to start with:** Keep the default selection and click *Next*.
    - **Install Recommended Proprietary Software:** Leave this option blank and click *Next*.
    - **How do you want to install Ubuntu:** Select *Erase disk and install Ubuntu" and click "Next.*
<br>
<br>

- Create an account, by following these steps:
    - **Enter your name:** Ubuntu Client.
    - **Provide your computer's name:** Ubuntu.
    - **Set your username:** ubuntu client.
    - **Choose a simple password of your choice:** ******
    - Ensure that the option to **Require my password to log in** is selected.
    - Click *Next*.
    - Select your time zone, then click *Next*.
    - Review your choices (if desired), and then click *Install*.
<br>
<br>

- Click *Next* and *Finish* on all pages of the **Welcome to Ubuntu** dialog to close the window.
<br>
<br>

- Right-click the desktop and select *Terminal*. Then, right-click the Terminal window and choose *Pin to Dash*.
<br>
<br>

- Enter the command 'ip a' into the command prompt. We can see under **inet** that the DHCP server has assigned this workstation an IP address of 10.0.0.12 and a subnet mask of /24.
<br>
<br>

We used `ip a` instead of `ifconfig` because `ifconfig` is not natively installed.

- To install the ifconfig tool type `sudo apt install net-tools`. Elevated privileges are required to install software, which is why we prefix the command with sudo.
<br>
<br>

- Now run the ifconfig command.
<br>
<br>

- As with the previous machines, ping Google to ensure you have internet connectivity: `ping -c 4 8.8.8.8`.
<br>
<br>

- To complete the update process, use the following commands: `sudo apt update` to refresh the package list, followed by `sudo apt upgrade -y` to upgrade the installed packages automatically.
<br>
<br>

- Rename the machine to "Ubuntu Client." Then, move the Ubuntu machine into the **SecLabs"** folder in the library pane.

## Ubuntu Server (Wazuh) Download and Configuration
The next virtual machine we will be working on is Ubuntu Server with Wazuh. Ubuntu Server is a specialized version of the Ubuntu operating system designed for server use. Wazuh is a free and open-source security platform used for various purposes, including threat detection, security monitoring, and compliance. It offers capabilities such as log analysis, intrusion detection, and vulnerability detection.

We will first install Ubuntu Server and then proceed to install Wazuh.

<br>
<br>

ifconfig is not natively installed on the Ubuntu Server, like it wasn’t on the client we installed previously. Let’s install it now.

- Type `sudo apt install net-tools`. Remember that elevated privileges are necessary for installations, which is why we use sudo.
<br>
<br>

- Type `ifconfig` into the command prompt and note the IP address, as you will need it to access the server shortly.
<br>
<br>

- To complete the process, update the machine by using the following commands: `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade -y`.
<br>
<br>

- On the **Daemons using outdated libraries** window, press *Tab* to select *Ok*, then press *Enter*. After that, press *Tab* again to select *Ok* and press *Enter*.

### Wazah Setup
- To download Wazuh from the Wazuh website, enter the following command into the command prompt: `curl -sO https://packages.wazuh.com/4.8/wazuh-install.sh`.

- Enter the command `ls` into the command prompt to confirm that Wazuh has been installed in the current working directory.

- To install Wazuh on the server, enter the following command: 

```
sudo bash ./wazuh-installation.sh -a
``` 

This command will initiate the installation process.

After the installation is complete, you will receive a username and password. Let’s change both of them.

- To download the file, use the following command: 

```bash
curl -so wazuh-passwords-tool.sh https://packages.wazuh.com/4.8/wazuh-passwords-tool.sh
```

*Note: The last command that was run is saying go download the Wazuh password tool from the proceeding web addressNote: The last command executed instructs to download the Wazuh password tool from the web address provided.*

- Use the command `ls` to check if the tool has been downloaded to the current working directory.

- To execute the script, run the following command:

```bash
sudo bash wazuh-passwords-tools.sh -u admin -p Secret3Pass4w*rd
``` 

This command uses `sudo` to run the script with administrative privileges, specifying the username as "admin" and the password as "Secret3Pass4w*rd".

We changed the password due to its length. The original password was very long, which made it easier to enter incorrectly. To save time and simplify the process, we needed to change it.

Once the password has been updated, we need to update the Wazuh Manager as instructed.

- To restart the Wazuh manager, run the following command: 

```bash
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
```

- Let's check the status of the Wazuh manager. Please run the command: `sudo systemctl status wazuh-manager`.

The output should indicate that the Wazuh Manager service is both active and running.

- Press *q* to exit.

Now, let's attempt to access the Wazuh Manager from the Ubuntu client.

- Return to the Ubuntu client and log in if logged out.

- Launch the Firefox browser.

- To proceed, enter 10.0.0.13 in the search bar. On the warning page, click the *Advanced* button, then select *Accept the Risk and Continue*.

- Log in using the admin username and the new password that we created.

- Click *Save* to store the password in your browser.

*Note:** *This practice should never be conducted in real-life scenarios, as an attacker could easily access all of your stored passwords if your system is compromised. However, doing this in our lab environment is acceptable, as it simplifies certain processes for us.*

Next, we need to install the Wazuh agent on the Ubuntu client.

- Click the *Add Agent* link.

- On the **Deploy New Agent** page, select the following: choose the package to download and install on your system - *Linux DEB amd64*. The server address should already be populated (10.0.0.13). In Optional Settings, assign an agent name - Ubuntu.

- You are now provided with command to download and install the agent, copy it and run it in the terminal's shell, ensuring you prepend `sudo` before pasting the command.

- Enter the password for the Ubuntu client when prompted.

- After installing the agent, return to Firefox and copy the final command to start the agent.

- Execute the command in the terminal shell, ensuring to prepend `sudo`.

- The command will reload the daemon, enable the agent, and start it.

- Check the status of the Wazuh agent to ensure it is enabled, active, and running by executing the command: `systemctl status wazuh-agent`.

- Press *q* to exit.

- Go back to Firefox and click on *Close*.

### Virtual Machine Connection Types
Let’s take a moment to explore the different types of network connections available for virtual machines. If you recall VMware Workstation Pro's Virtual Network Editor, we encountered three network connection types: bridged, host-only, and NAT (Network Address Translation).

**Bridged Mode -** When a virtual machine is using a bridged connection:
- The virtual machine obtains its IP address from the LAN router's DHCP server, allowing it to function as a separate physical machine on the network.
- The virtual machine is directly connected to the physical network, enabling it to communicate with other devices on the network and access the Internet.
- The host machine's network adapter serves as a bridge, enabling the virtual machine's network traffic to flow from the virtualized environment to the physical network and subsequently to the external network (Internet).
- Used when the VM requires full network access and is directly addressable from the physical network's subnet.

**NAT (Network Address Translation) Mode -** When a virtual machine is using a NAT connection:
- The virtual machine is assigned a unique IP address by the hypervisor's DHCP server.
- To access the external network, Network Address Translation (NAT) is used to convert the virtual machine's IP address to the public IP address of the host machine. The host machine's public IP address is recorded in the host's NAT table. This setup enables the host machine to function as a router.
- NAT conceals the VM's IP address. The VM uses the host's public IP address on the Internet, making it seem as though network traffic originates from the host machine rather than the virtual machine.

**Host-Only Mode -** When a virtual machine is using a host-only connection:
- The virtual machine is isolated which establishes a private connection with the host, thereby only allowing communication with the host and other virtual machines in host-only mode.
- A secure sandboxed environment is established for malware analysis and reverse engineering.
- The virtual machine cannot access the external network (Internet) because it is isolated. Thus, it has no network access.
  
Understanding these connection types can help you choose the best option for your specific virtual machine requirements.
