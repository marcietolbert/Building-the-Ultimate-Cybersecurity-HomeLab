# SEC, SOC, Malware Analysis VM Setup

Welcome to **Lab 00**, the first lab in the **Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** series. In this walkthrough, I will guide you through the process of downloading and configuring five virtual machines using VMware Workstation Pro. Before we dive into the technical steps of building the lab, let's take a moment to logically examine the environment. To accomplish this, I will create a logical diagram using Draw.io.

## Mandatory System Requirements

The mandatory system Requirements are as follows: 
- **RAM:** 32 GB (gigabytes) of RAM or **higher**
