# SEC, SOC, Malware Analysis VM Setup

Welcome to **Lab 00**, the inaugural lab in the **Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** series. In this guided session, I will walk you through the steps to download and configure six distinct virtual machines that will be hosted on VMware Workstation Pro. Additionally, I will provide clear instructions on how to download and set up VMware Workstation Pro itself.

Before diving into the configuration process, we’ll take a moment to explore the logical structure of our lab network. This visual representation will help you understand how the various components interact with one another. To create this logical diagram, we will use Draw.io, a user-friendly online diagramming tool. Let’s get started!

## Network Diagram



## Mandatory System Requirements

The mandatory system requirements for your host machine are as follows: 
- **RAM:** 32 GB (gigabytes) of RAM or **higher**
- **CPU:** 64-BIT 2.0+ GHz processor or ***higher**
- **Disk:** 500GB of SSD or **higher**

## Lab Environment
- VMware Workstation Pro (Hypervisor)
- Kali (Attack Machine)
- Metasploitable (Vulnerable Target)
- FLARE VM (Win10, Reverse engineering / sandboxed malware analysis machine)
- Wazuh (Ubuntu Server, SIEM/Security Monitoring)
- Unbuntu Client (Workstation)
- Security Onion (Threat Hunting. Security Monitoring, Log Management)

## Hypervisor Installation

Our first priority will be to install VMware Workstation Pro, which is the software that enables us to run multiple virtual machines on a single physical machine.
