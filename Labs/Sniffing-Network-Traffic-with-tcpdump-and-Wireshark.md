# Sniffing Network Traffic with tcpdump and Wireshark
Welcome to **Lab 00**, the first in the **Building the Ultimate Cybersecurity HomeLab** series. In this guided session, I will walk you through the steps to download and configure six distinct virtual machines that will be hosted on VMware Workstation Pro. Additionally, I will provide clear instructions on how to download and configure VMware Workstation Pro.

Before we begin the configuration process, let's first examine the logical structure of our lab environment. This visual representation will help you understand how the devices in this lab interact with one another. We will use Lucidchart, a user-friendly online diagramming tool, to create this logical diagram. 

Letâ€™s get started!
